# Retro Game Themed Portfolio 🎮
A simple portfolio made with Javascript and some inner love for pixelated retro games. It's interactive and fun, I'll recommend do checking it out
This project is a little passion project that turned into a portfolio. Crafted with more hours and  pixelated-powered-enthusiasm than I'm probably willing to admit, just know I put a part of my heart here. 
It's interactive and fun, I'll recommend do checking it out!
Feel free to share, reuse and get inspired by it!
 ## Created With ❤️.
